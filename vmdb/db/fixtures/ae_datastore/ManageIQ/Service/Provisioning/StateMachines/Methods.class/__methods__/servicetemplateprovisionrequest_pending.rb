#
# Description: This method is used to email the service requester that
# the Service request was not auto-approved
#
# Event: request_pending
#
# Model Notes:
# 1. to_email_address - used to specify an email address in the case where the
#    requester does not have a valid email address. To specify more than one email
#    address separate email address with commas. (I.e. admin@company.com,user@company.com)
# 2. from_email_address - used to specify an email address in the event the
#    requester replies to the email
# 3. signature - used to stamp the email with a custom signature
